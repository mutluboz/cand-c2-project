Since we have a pretty good budget I decided to upgrade my EC2 instances for better performance. I also think a no-sql solution is a must in todayâ€™s modern web apps so I add DocumentDb for no-sql use cases like in app chat. A memcache can drastically increase app performance thus improve user experience so I Add Elasticache service. Finally I add MQ service to properly implement a micro service based architecture.
